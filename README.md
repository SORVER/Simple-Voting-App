# Simple Voting App
## Introduction
This project implements a simple real-time voting application using Flask and SocketIO. The application allows users to vote on a question by clicking on one of three buttons: "Yes", "No", or "Maybe". The votes are then displayed in real time as colored rectangles, with the width of each rectangle reflecting the proportion of votes it received.
